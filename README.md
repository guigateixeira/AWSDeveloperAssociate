## Section 6: EC2 Instance Storage

EBS Volume:

* A EBS (Elastic Block Storage) Volume is a netowkr drive that you can attach to your instances while they run.
* It Allows your instances to persist data, even after termination.
* They can only be mounted to one instance at a time.
* They are bounded to a specific availability zone (Can't put a es-east-1a EBS to a instance in es-east-1b).
