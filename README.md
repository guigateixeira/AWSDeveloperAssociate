* A EBS (Elastic Block Storage) Volume is a network drive that you can attach to your instances while they run.
* It Allows your instances to persist data, even after termination.
* They can only be mounted to one instance at a time.
* They are bounded to a specific availability zone (Can't put a us-east-1a EBS to a instance in us-east-1b).

It's mainly used to get data back from a instance that stoped into a new instance. (It's almost like a "network USB stick)

* It's a network drive (not a physical drive).
  * It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency.
  * It can be detached from a EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly. (Makes its handy to do fails-over)
 
* It's locked to an AZ, and to move a volume across, you need to snapshopt it.

* Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs and IOPS).

  Delete on Terminate:

  Controls the EBS behaviour when an EC2 instance terminates
  * By default, the root EBS volume is deleted (enabled).
  * By default, any other attached EBS volume is not deleted.
 
  If you want to preser the data from root when it's terminated we need to disable this attribute.

  #### EBS Snapshots

  * Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time.
  * Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but it is recommended.
  * Can copy snapshots across AZ or Regions.

  EBS Snapshots Features:
  * EBS Snapshot Archive:
    * Move Snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper.
    * Takes 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive.

  * Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots
    * Setup rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover them afyer an accidental deletion.
    * Specific retation (from 1 day to 1 year).

   * Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
     * Force full initialization of snapshot to have no latency on the first use (very expensive $$$).
    
   **We can create volume from snapshots.**
