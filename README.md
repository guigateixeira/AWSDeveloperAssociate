## Section 6: EC2 Instance Storage

### EBS Volume:

* A EBS (Elastic Block Storage) Volume is a network drive that you can attach to your instances while they run.
* It Allows your instances to persist data, even after termination.
* They can only be mounted to one instance at a time.
* They are bounded to a specific availability zone (Can't put a us-east-1a EBS to a instance in us-east-1b).

It's mainly used to get data back from a instance that stoped into a new instance. (It's almost like a "network USB stick)

* It's a network drive (not a physical drive).
  * It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency.
  * It can be detached from a EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly. (Makes its handy to do fails-over)
 
* It's locked to an AZ, and to move a volume across, you need to snapshopt it.

* Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs and IOPS).

  Delete on Terminate:

  Controls the EBS behaviour when an EC2 instance terminates
  * By default, the root EBS volume is deleted (enabled).
  * By default, any other attached EBS volume is not deleted.
 
  If you want to preser the data from root when it's terminated we need to disable this attribute
